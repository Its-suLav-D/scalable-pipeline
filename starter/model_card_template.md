# Model Card

## Model Details
* Developer: [Your Name]
* Model date: [Date]
* Model version: 1.0
* Model type: Random Forest Classifier
* Training Data: Census Income Dataset
* Software: Python 3.8+, scikit-learn 0.24+, pandas 1.2+, numpy 1.19+

## Intended Use
* Primary intended uses: This model is an example of bias in machine learning, particularly with regards to race and gender.
* Primary intended users: Students and researchers interested in algorithmic bias.
* Out-of-scope use cases: This model should not be used in any real-world applications for determining an individual's income or for any decision-making processes.

## Factors
* Relevant factors: The model uses demographic information including age, workclass, education, marital status, occupation, relationship status, race, sex, and native country.
* Evaluation factors: The model's performance was evaluated across different slices of the data, particularly focusing on protected attributes like race and gender.

## Metrics
* Model performance measures: The model was evaluated using precision, recall, and F1 score.
* Decision thresholds: The default decision threshold of 0.5 was used.
* Variation approaches: Performance for different slices of the data is reported in the `slice_output.txt` file.

## Ethical Considerations
* This model uses demographic information which could lead to biased predictions, particularly with respect to race and gender.
* The dataset and model may reflect historical biases present in census data collection and societal income disparities.
* Users of this model should be aware of
